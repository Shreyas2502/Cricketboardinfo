<p style="color:blue"> The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the governing body for cricket in India and is under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India. The board was formed in December 1928 as a society, registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act. It is a consortium of state cricket associations and the state associations select their representatives who in turn elect the BCCI Chief. Its headquarters are in Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. Grant Govan was its first president and Anthony De Mello its first secretary. </p>

<h2 style="color:red;">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p  style="color:blue">
Neither does the BCCI follow a structure like other sports bodies in the world, nor does it have a corporate structure. It does not follow laws of corporate governance either. The board functioned from the residence of whoever was the president, till about 2006. It used to be headquartered in a small one- and- a- half room office near to Mumbai’s Brabourne Stadium. Today, the BCCI is housed in the spanking stone-and-glass Cricket Centre at the Wankhede Stadium. 

The BCCI’s moment of transition came in November 1991, when the South African cricket team toured India, their first international assignment after a 21-year ban for apartheid. The BCCI, from this tour, earned its first TV rights when the South African Broadcasting Corporation paid the BCCI to broadcast an India series by a foreign firm. Today, the BCCI is worth over Rs 3,000 crore and its arrangement with the ICC, the world’s cricket body, only makes it richer. Under the current revenue-sharing model, BCCI gets close to 3-4% of the surplus earned by ICC. This may go up as it is likely to get 21-22% of the gross revenue over the next six-eight years. If the ICC earns anything between $2.5 and $3.5 billion, reports say that BCCI may is expected to get $550-770 million over the eight-year period.
